## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

---

## Key Concepts

### Repository
A repository is a directory that contains all of your project's files and the entire revision history.

### Branch
Branches are used to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

### Commit
A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It contains metadata, including the author, date, and commit message.

### Merge
Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch.

### Clone
Cloning a repository means creating a copy of it on your local machine.

---

## Basic Commands

### Initialize Repository
```bash
git init
```
Creates a new Git repository.

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
Clones a repository into a new directory.

### Check Status
```bash
git status
```
Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.

### Add Files
```bash
git add <file-name>
```
Adds a file to the staging area.

### Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
Records changes to the repository.

### Push Changes
```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```
Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.

### Pull Changes
```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```
Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository to the local repository.

### Branching
```bash
git branch <new-branch-name>
git checkout <new-branch-name>
```
Creates a new branch and switches to it.

### Merging
```bash
git checkout <branch-to-merge-into>
git merge <branch-to-merge>
```
Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

---

## Advanced Commands

### Stashing
```bash
git stash
git stash apply
```
Temporarily shelves changes made to the working directory.

### Rebasing
```bash
git rebase <branch-name>
```
Reapplies commits on top of another base tip.

### Cherry-pick
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```
Applies the changes introduced by some existing commits.

---

## Useful Tips
- **Undo Last Commit**: `git commit --amend`
- **List Branches**: `git branch -a`
- **Show Commit History**: `git log`
